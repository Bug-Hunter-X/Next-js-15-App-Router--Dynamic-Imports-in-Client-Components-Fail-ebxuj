# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic Imports in Client Components Fail

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15's App Router where dynamic imports in client components fail to render, even when the imports are successful.

## Bug Description

When using dynamic `import()` statements within a client component in the App Router, the component may not render correctly, despite the import resolving successfully. This leads to unexpected behavior and broken functionality.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe that the client component fails to render the imported content.

## Expected Behavior

The client component should correctly render the content imported dynamically.

## Actual Behavior

The client component does not render, resulting in a blank space or an error.

## Solution

The solution involves refactoring the component to use a different approach for loading and rendering the imported content, often using Suspense and lazy loading techniques.
